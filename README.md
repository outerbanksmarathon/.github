The 2024 Outer Banks Marathon Weekend will take place from November 9-10 in Manteo, NC. Due to logistical challenges involving a bridge closure on the full marathon route, the 26.2-mile marathon has been canceled for this year. However, runners can still participate in the popular Half Marathon, 8K, 5K, and Fun Run events, which will continue as scheduled.
